title: 'Rainfall--Runoff Game'
---

*The rainfalll--runoff game is a way to give you intuition into how
rainfall and runoff move across the landscape and produce river
discharge.*

Backstory
=========

A rainfall event just covered the landscape in a certain depth of water.
You are a hydrologist who is working to simulate the resultant river
discharge based on a set of simple rules and a gameboard that represents
your watershed.

Play this game **in pairs**. You will play multiple times, taking turns
with who is setting up the board and who is helping to count and follow
the rules.

Materials
=========

1.  Pen or pencil

2.  (optional) Markers of different colors to create your game board

3.  One hex-grid paper for each game that you will play

4.  Scratch paper or a note-taking device to record game configuration
    as well as discharge through time at the river outlet

Setting up the board
====================

1.  Write both team members' names on the board.

2.  Draw the outline of a drainage basin on the hex paper, making sure
    to draw around the edges of full hexes. Standard example drainage
    basins have a tear-drop shape, but real drainage basins come in many
    shapes.

3.  Draw one or a few lines to represent rivers.

    -   These lines must go from one hex center to another

    -   They must form a convergent network

    -   Consider the minimum drainage area at which a river forms;
        ensure that this is approximately consistent across your
        landscape.

    -   If you need inspiration, study real river networks, perhaps in
        Google Maps topographic view or on other maps that you find
        online.

Gameplay
========

Setup
-----

For your first play-through, we will simulate a "unit hydrograph": A
rainstorm of a single "unit" size that covers the entire watershed
uniformally. Later games may involve different initial conditions.

1.  Begin by placing one counter **red**-side up in each cell. The red
    side indicates that this is surface water -- the rainfall that has
    just fallen.

2.  Decide on the subsurface storage capacity of the cells. The default
    choice is 1. Write this on your map.

3.  Decide on the infiltration rate. The default choice is 1. Write this
    on your map.

In each round
-------------

1.  **Streamflow.** Move all counters on river cells 5 cells downstream.
    If these counters exit the map, save them in a "discharge" pile.

2.  **Infiltration.** In each cell that contains surface water (red) is
    not already at its subsurface-water storage capacity, flip a number
    of surface-water pieces equal to the **infiltration rate** so their
    **yellow** sides are showing. This indicates water that this water
    has infiltrated into the subsurface. If infiltration would exceed
    the storage capacity of the cell, only infiltrate enough water (flip
    enough game pieces) as the cell can hold.

3.  **Exfiltration.** If a cell contains more water than it should be
    able to hold, flip all of these game pieces in excess of the storage
    capacity so their red (surface-water) sides are showing. This excess
    water exceeds the subsurface storage capacity and exfiltrates.

4.  **Overland flow.** Move the surface water counters *two cells*
    towards the nearest river. Do this in order from most downstream to
    most upstream; this is in order to make sure that you do not
    accidentally move a counter twice. If a counter reaches a river on
    the first move, move it two additional spaces downstream, for a
    total of three cells. Save any of these counters that exit the map
    in the "discharge" pile.

5.  **Subsurface flow.** Again, starting from the most downstream
    counters and moving to the most upstream ones, move all of the
    counters representing shallow subsurface flow towards the nearest
    river. These counters move *one cell* only.

6.  **Discharge.** Count how many counters exited the map during this
    round and record this number alongside the game-round number. Then,
    place these game pieces in a discard pile. These data eventually
    will form your hydrograph.

Repeat this until all of the counters have exited your map.

After your first game, generate an experiment to test some aspect of the
hydrological system and how it might affect river discharge. Options
include:

-   Changing the number of channels (i.e., the *drainage density*).

-   Changing the shape of the drainage basin.

-   Changing the subsurface storage capacity, for example, to two
    counters of water -- this represents soils that can hold more water.

-   Changing the infiltration rate -- the number of game pieces (water)
    that can infiltrate during each round.

-   Adding more rainfall -- two or three counters per cell, for example,
    could indicate a larger initial storm.

-   Adding additional water during several rounds, for example, to
    indicate a longer duration storm. Will you eventually reach a steady
    state (water out = water in)?

-   Adding rainfall to only part of the map (e.g., for an isolated
    storm).

Each group will need to play at least three games.

Assignment (35 points)
======================

*You may share your materials for submission, but each student will need
to submit their own work and write-up. Include the name of your partner
with your write up.*

1.  **(15 points)** Plot three or more hydrographs with discharge
    (counters) vs. time (game rounds). Beneath each hydrograph, include
    a photo of the board layout and information on the options chosen.
    *You will also be graded on the realism of your watersheds; you may
    be creative, but they must be plausible.*

2.  **(10 points)** Describe which experiment you ran and what you
    found. Discuss what you learned in a hydrological context. A
    detailed interpretation that implies knowledge of watershed
    processes is expected.

3.  **(5 points)** Tile drains to rivers in the Midwest now make shallow
    subsurface water flow move much more quickly. Explain how this
    should shift and/or otherwise alter the flood peak, and if you would
    like, play the game again (and record the results) by allowing all
    subsurface flow to follow surface-water flow rules. This latter step
    is not required, but will ensure that you have a reasonable answer
    to this question (and should be quick, as it simplifies gameplay).

4.  **(5 points)** Based on our discussions of threshold shear stresses
    for sediment transport and erosion, which kinds of floods do you
    think might be most important for landscape evolution?
